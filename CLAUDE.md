# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

vyb-code is a local AI coding assistant that provides Claude Code-equivalent functionality using local LLMs. The project aims to offer privacy-focused AI coding assistance with a natural "vibe" development experience.

**Core Concept**: "Feel the rhythm of perfect code" - Local LLM-based coding assistant prioritizing privacy and developer experience.

**Current Status**: Phase 2 completed with command execution, Git integration, project analysis, and multi-language support foundation. Ready for Phase 3 development.

## Architecture

This is a Go-based CLI application with the following planned structure:

```
vyb-code/
├── cmd/vyb/              # Main CLI entry point
├── internal/
│   ├── llm/             # LLM integration (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM)
│   ├── tools/           # File operations, command execution, Git
│   ├── chat/            # Conversation session management
│   ├── config/          # Configuration management
│   ├── cache/           # Response caching
│   └── security/        # Security constraints
└── pkg/types/           # Public type definitions
```

## Development Commands

```bash
# Build the project
go build -o vyb ./cmd/vyb

# Test the build
./vyb config list

# Run tests (when implemented)
go test ./...

# Run specific package tests
go test ./internal/config -v
go test ./internal/llm -v

# Get dependencies
go mod tidy

# Lint (when configured)
golangci-lint run
```

## Technical Stack

- **Language**: Go (chosen for performance, single binary distribution, concurrency)
- **LLM Integration**: HTTP API via Ollama (primary), LM Studio, vLLM
- **Recommended Models**:
  - Qwen2.5-Coder 32B/14B (primary)
  - DeepSeek-Coder-V2 16B (balanced)
  - CodeLlama 34B (stability)

## Key Requirements

### Core MVP Features

1. **Interactive CLI**: Real-time conversation with multi-turn context
2. **File Operations**: Read/write files, project search
3. **Command Execution**: Secure shell command execution (30s timeout)
4. **Git Integration**: Branch operations, commit generation, diff analysis

### Security Constraints

- **Local-only execution** (no external data transmission)
- **Command whitelist**: Restricted command execution
- **File access limits**: Project directory only
- **Input validation**: Injection attack prevention

### Performance Targets

- LLM response: <10 seconds
- File operations: <1 second  
- Memory usage: <100MB (excluding LLM)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: MVP (✅ Completed)

- ✅ Basic CLI structure with Cobra
- ✅ Ollama integration with HTTP API client
- ✅ File read/write operations with security constraints
- ✅ Interactive chat mode with conversation history
- ✅ Configuration management with JSON persistence

### Phase 2: Feature Expansion (✅ Completed)

- ✅ Command execution with security constraints (whitelist, timeout)
- ✅ Git integration (branch management, commits, status)
- ✅ Project analysis (language detection, dependencies, structure)
- ✅ Multi-language support foundation (Go, JS, Python)

### Phase 3: Quality & Distribution (2 weeks)

- Testing infrastructure
- Performance optimization
- Package distribution
- Documentation

## Development Priorities

1. **Privacy First**: All processing must remain local
2. **Security**: Implement comprehensive command/file access restrictions
3. **Performance**: Optimize for responsive user experience
4. **Extensibility**: Design for future plugin/template systems

## Configuration

**Implemented configuration system** using `~/.vyb/config.json`:

- ✅ LLM provider and model selection (`vyb config set-model`, `vyb config set-provider`)
- ✅ Timeout and file size limits
- ✅ Workspace mode restrictions
- 🔄 Security settings and command restrictions - Planned

**Current config commands:**
```bash
vyb config list                    # Show current settings
vyb config set-model <model>       # Set LLM model
vyb config set-provider <provider> # Set LLM provider
```

**Phase 2 commands:**
```bash
# Command execution
vyb exec <command>                 # Execute shell command securely

# Git operations
vyb git status                     # Show git status
vyb git branch [name]              # Create/list branches
vyb git commit <message>           # Create commit

# Project analysis
vyb analyze                        # Analyze project structure
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Comments

- **All comments must be in Japanese** for better readability by Japanese developers
- Include both technical explanations and purpose of functions/types
- Use format: `// 日本語での説明 (English technical terms if needed)`

### Git Workflow

- **Exclude AI attribution in commits**: Do not include "Generated with Claude Code" or "Co-Authored-By: Claude"
- **Clean commit messages**: Focus on clear, concise descriptions of changes
- **PR process**: Use feature branches, create descriptive PRs without AI-generated footers
- Follow conventional commit format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.
